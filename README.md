## Project Overview

This group project involved writing 15 MongoDB aggregation queries to analyze data on U.S. government officials. Using the provided `executives.json` and `legislators.json` datasets, we crafted queries to extract insights on presidents, vice presidents, legislators, their terms, party affiliations, and more.

## Provided Data

- `executives.json`: Data on U.S. executives including presidents and vice presidents.  
- `legislators.json`: Data on U.S. legislators with biographical and term information.

---

## Key Contributions

- Developed and optimized aggregation queries to retrieve and analyze political data.  
- Queries include filtering, grouping, joining, and date calculations using the MongoDB Aggregation Framework.  
- Focused on solving real-world data retrieval challenges with NoSQL databases.

---

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB  
- MongoDB Aggregation Framework  
- JSON datasets  
- Mongo Shell / Compass

---

## Usage

1. Import the JSON files into a MongoDB database (e.g., `project2`).  
2. Run the aggregation queries in `queries.mongodb.js` within the database context.  
3. Modify queries to explore further insights as needed.
